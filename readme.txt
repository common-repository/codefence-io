== Description ==

codefence.io is an easy to embed editor and compiler for over 20 server-side programming languages.

Everything is run securely inside dedicated sandboxed Docker containers and, once executed, destroyed. We never store your code on our servers, and only the results are cached (you can opt-out of this as well).

Perfect for examples, tutorials, and technical documentation, allowing the reader to interact with the code and make changes.
